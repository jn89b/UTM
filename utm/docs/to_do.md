# To do 02/16/2022
- [X] Control multiple UAS with simple flight
- [X] Do this by making automated CSV parser to JSON,like PX4
- [X] Test and make sure it can control all UAS with correct namespace
- [X] **Make sure the simple_flight_drone.py listens to the launch file correctly**

# Notes from 02/16/2022
- Can only control up to 14 UAS without some CPU throttling, am I capped by hardware specs?
- Optimize code

# To doc
- [] Fly multiple UAS with waypoint commands to the system 
- [] See if I can add the hiearchial path planning to UAS
- []
