# Using Simple Flight Drone 

## simple_flight_drone.py
- This class controls a UAS, and listens to incoming waypoint commands

## How to launch multiple drones with simple_flight_Stack
- Launch the following files:
```
roslaunch simple_drone.launch
```

This will launch a file with a given namespace parameter for the UAS and run the simple_flight_drone.py


## Additional Notes
- Can save FPS and computation by removing cameras, if I don't need them
